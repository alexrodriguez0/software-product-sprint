      <p>Hi! My name is Alex and I'm from Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. 
          I'm a rising senior at Brown University concentrating in Computer Science. 
          I'm interested in Machine Learning and low-level programming. 
          Outside of CS, I've taken courses in Economics, Anthropology and more! 
          Most of the projects I've worked on recently are low-level and in C or 
          implemenations of ML models in Python. Some of these are:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Implementation of a file system called S5FS -- 
                  open, close, mkdir, and other such functions</li>
              <li>Implementation of a user threads package</li>
              <li>Implementation of a logistic regression model</li>
          </ul>
          Some things I like are:
          <ul>
              <li>Reading</li>
              <li>Meditating</li>
              <li>Drinking coffee</li>
              <li>Learning something new about anything at all</li>
              <li>Listening to music</li>
              <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
              <li>Photography</li>
          </ul> 
      <p>These are some of the pictures I've taken:</p>
