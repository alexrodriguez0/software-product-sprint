        <p>Hi! My name is Alex and I'm from Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. 
            I'm a rising senior at Brown University concentrating in Computer Science. 
            I've taken courses in Machine Learning and Operating Systems. Outside of CS, 
            I've explored in Economics, Anthropology and more. I'm a fan of warm weather,
            ramen and running. In my free time I like to read and hang with friends.
            I'm also a big appreciator of fashion, photography and music. Finally, I 
            speak both Spanish and English. You can find me on 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-rodriguez-evans/">LinkedIn</a> 
            and <a href="https://github.com/alexrodriguez0">GitHub</a>. </p>

        <h2>Pojects I've worked on:</h2>   
        <p>Most of the projects I've worked on recently are low-level and in C or 
        implemenations of ML models in Python. Some of these are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation of a file system called S5FS -- 
                open, close, mkdir, and other such functions</li>
            <li>Implementation of a user threads package</li>
            <li>Implementation of a logistic regression model</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Some of the things I like are:</h2>     
        <ul>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Meditating</li>
            <li>Drinking coffee</li>
            <li>Learning something new about anything at all</li>
            <li>Listening to music</li>
            <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
            <li>Photography</li>
        </ul>

      <img src="/images/nyc.jpg" alt="Picture in NYC" width="300" height="200">
      <p>The first picture is from a photoshoot I did with a friend in Santurce (an area in San Juan, PR). The second
          picture is from a family trip to Culebra, PR and the third is a picture I took from a taxi in NYC. I like
          to both coordinate shots I imagine in my head and capture things I see while I'm out and about. </p>
